# Issues/Bugs
(1) Unfortunately the calendar does not update automatically, so to see the event you just
created, it is necessary to either refresh the server or go back a month and then return.
Furthermore, I have been unable to change the "New event" to something else ("do laundry"), despite the fact that the code to do that is there.

(2) Sometimes the r/w restriction access does not work and the calendar is displayed despite
the fact that there is no user signed in.
